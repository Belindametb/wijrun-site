Where it all started…. I had just gotten the news that I passed my final board exam and we were celebrating somewhere in Jhb. We left to try a find a place that would sell us food at 12am. We ended up sharing an Uber on our way back to Parkhurst and we started discussing our plans for 2016. I had no idea what I was going to do, once you go the CA route (well at least for me) you get so focused on passing the next exam that you dont really think about what to do next once you reach the finish line. Our friends explained that they had decided to move to Amsterdam, and that we should join them.

And the rest is history, we got married in September and got our Visa’s at the end of November and left SA that December.
The idea of the blog is to share our experience of running and travelling across Europe, we hope the information will make your trip a bit easier!

Below is a little video we shot while running in Amsterdam, we joined the Runkeeper 5km challenge and happen to run into the Kevin Hart – Hartfoundation 5km run!

We hope you will enjoy the journey with us!

The last two months have been a whirlwind of emotions, adventure and have been very exciting!
